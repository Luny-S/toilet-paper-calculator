# Toilet Paper Score Calculator

This is a simple web-based tool for calculating the "toilet paper score" based on various parameters of a toilet paper roll. 
The idea for this tool is something that many people have thought about, and likely many have implemented, but this time, it's entirely generated by AI with some prompts from a humble software developer.

## What is the Toilet Paper Score?

The toilet paper score is a simple metric that aims to help consumers make informed decisions when purchasing toilet paper rolls. It takes into account the number of sheets, number of layers, and the price of the roll. The formula for calculating the score is as follows:

**Score = Price / (Number of Sheets * Number of Layers)**

## How to Use the Calculator

1. Enter the **Number of Sheets** and **Number of Layers** of the toilet paper roll.
2. Toggle between two input sections:
   - **Price Input Section**: Enter the price of the roll in local currency.
   - **Number of Rolls and Price for Package Section**: Enter the number of rolls and the price for the package in local currency.
3. Click the **Calculate Score** button to see the calculated toilet paper score.
